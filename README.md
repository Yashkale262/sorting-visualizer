# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project is a frontend application developed using React, aimed at providing a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. The application allows users to observe the sorting algorithms in real-time, with adjustable array size and algorithm speed options.

## Features
- Supports the following sorting algorithms:
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Bubble sort
  - Heap sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
- User-friendly interface with adjustable array size: Users can choose the size of the array to be sorted, allowing them to observe the algorithms on different scales.
- Algorithm speed control: Users can adjust the speed at which the sorting algorithms are visualized, providing a customizable experience.
- Real-time speed adjustment: The application allows users to change the visualization speed even while the algorithm is running, enabling them to closely observe the sorting process at their preferred pace.
